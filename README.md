# README
 A social network named "CLK" (get it?) created with Rails, Javascript and React.

 Created by:
   Rina Ramkalawan (Robinson)
   Kendy Ng
   Sam Glickman
   
This team worked on CLK for 2 days to explore using React for the first time.
We managed our team using agile workflow (Trello).

Trickiest part: AcitveRecord associations :/
Biggest success: friend requests.
